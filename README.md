# Kazanto

Step into the pixelated realm where the classic adventure of Pokémon meets the simplicity and charm of your terminal. In this unique experience, you'll embark on an epic quest to become the ultimate Pokémon Master, right from the command line! 

Explore different areas, discover the vast amount of the classic and modern pokémons. Catch, evolve, fulfill your pokédex, create you party, fight and conquer. The old experience, which never gets old, awaits you.

## How To Play

You can play Kazanto by simply forking this repository and running ```go run .``` in the root of the project.

When running the game, you can type ```help``` for all the available commmands at your dispose.

## Future Features

As for now, Kazanto is missing a lot of main features:

- Pokémon fights (trainers, random encounters);
- No experience gains and no evolving;
- ~Pokéballs~;
- Pokémon Party;
- Quality of Life.
